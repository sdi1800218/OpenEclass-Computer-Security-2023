    <h1>Too Many Puppies</h1>
    <p>Too many puppies are being shot in the dark.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies are trained not to bark.</p>
    <p>At the sight of blood that must be spilled so that we may maintain</p>
    <p>Our oil fields.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies are taught to heal.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies are trained to kill.</p>
    <p>On the command of men wearing money belts that buy mistresses</p>
    <p>Sleek animal pelts.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies.</p>
    <p>Skinny was born in a bathtub</p>
    <p>And he grew so incredibly thin</p>
    <p>Even the tide from the eyedropper sucked him in</p>
    <p>Skinny never knew any questions</p>
    <p>Skinny never looked alike</p>
    <p>Skinny sold somethin' every single night</p>
    <p>Skinny sold a soldier to me</p>
    <p>Skinny sold the wife</p>
    <p>Skinny sold a suction cup and a knife</p>
    <p>Skinny found a hello dolly record in the house.</p>
    <p>Sold it to a truck driver in the night.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies with guns in their hands.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies in foreign lands.</p>
    <p>Are dressed up sharp in suits of green and placed upon the war machine.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies are just like me.</p>
    <p>Too many puppies are afraid to see.</p>
    <p>The visions of the past brought to life again,</p>
    <p>Too many puppies, too many dead men.</p>
